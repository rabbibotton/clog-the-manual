The **Common Lisp Omnificent GUI**, CLOG for short, uses web technology to produce graphical user interfaces for applications locally or remotely. CLOG can take the place, or work alongside, most cross-platform GUI frameworks and website frameworks. The CLOG package starts up the connectivity to the browser or other websocket client (often a browser embedded in a native application.)

CLOG tech was invented (first in Ada) and has been running in commercial production code and products since 2013 and in Common Lisp since 2022. CLOG is used in commerical products, websites, and other opensource projects.

CLOG is being actively extended, the core API is stable and proven, the CLOG Builder is rich in features and is a full featured general purpose IDE for Common Lisp and web development (including support for working on JavaScript, HTML and more) and includes a GUI Builder for the CLOG Framework.
