!!! info

    Rabbi, we need to discuss this section when you get a chance. This needs to be fleshed out and we need to chat about related items.
    
1. Develop a non-builder IDE and keeping the builder as a separate feature.
2. Create a way to save and resture the state of a GUI session and even make those sessions storable in a database.
3. At this point I feel "safe" to expand the features of a website extension to CLOG without people mistake CLOG as just another web framework and not a GUI + Web + Mobile framework.
4. Headless operation (more on this later but using headless browsers) with streaming video / audio
